PAGE {
    The GROUP BY expression groups the rows by a specific column or columns.

    After grouping, an aggregate value for each group can be calculated.
}

PAGE {
    EXAMPLE {
        TABLE {
            Animals
            id | name | species | weight
            1 | Wilfried | dragon | 3500
            2 | Fred | sheep | 500
            3 | Justus | dragon | 7500
            4 | Tabaluca | dragon | 6000
            5 | Ake | sheep | 800
        }
        QUERY {
            SELECT species, COUNT (*) FROM Animals GROUP BY species;
        }
    }
}

PAGE {
    The COUNT, SUM, MAX, and MIN functions can be used in the aggregation.

    In a GROUP BY the aggregate value is calculated for each group separately.
}

PAGE {
    EXAMPLE {
        TABLE {
            Animals
            id | name | species | weight
            1 | Wilfried | dragon | 3500
            2 | Fred | sheep | 500
            3 | Justus | dragon | 7500
            4 | Tabaluca | dragon | 6000
            5 | Ake | sheep | 800
        }
        QUERY {
            SELECT species, SUM (weight) FROM Animals GROUP BY species;
        }
    }
}

PAGE {
    You can use conditions with grouping in the same way as you would with other queries.
}

PAGE {
    EXAMPLE {
        TABLE {
            Animals
            id | name | species | weight
            1 | Wilfried | dragon | 3500
            2 | Fred | sheep | 500
            3 | Justus | dragon | 7500
            4 | Tabaluca | dragon | 6000
            5 | Ake | sheep | 800
        }
        QUERY {
            SELECT species, COUNT (*) FROM Animals WHERE weight <5000 GROUP BY species;
        }
    }
}

PAGE {
    The word HAVING can be used to specify a condition that is checked only after grouping.

    In this case, the condition can also refer to the aggregate.

    For example, the following query only shows groups with more than 2 rows.
}

PAGE {
    EXAMPLE {
        TABLE {
            Animals
            id | name | species | weight
            1 | Wilfried | dragon | 3500
            2 | Fred | sheep | 500
            3 | Justus | dragon | 7500
            4 | Tabaluca | dragon | 6000
            5 | Ake | sheep | 800
        }
        QUERY {
            SELECT species, COUNT (*) FROM Animals GROUP BY species HAVING COUNT (*)> 2;
        }
    }
}
