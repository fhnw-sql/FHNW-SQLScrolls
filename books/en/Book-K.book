    Our startup will be trading in Pok√©mon. We need some reports 
    to help us shape our business strategy. The Pokedex table
    constains more rows then we can see on a page, see 
    https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/all. A Pok√©mon has
    one or two names and belongs to one or two types.

    Every Pok√©mon has HPs (Hit Points) which are its life force. If HP hits zero, 
    it faints and can't fight in battle (it can use Hidden Machines). The Speed 
    decides which Pok√©mon will make the first move in battle. This is critical. 
    Attack and Special Attack measure the strength of moves; the higher this is, 
    the more damage you will do to opponents. Attack corresponds to moves in the
    Physical category, while Special Attack corresponds to Special moves. 
    Defense and Special Defense measure the ability to counter attacks from other 
    Pok√©mon; the higher they are, the fewer Hit Points are lost when attacked. 
    Defense corresponds to moves in the Physical category, while Special Defense
    corresponds to Special moves.
