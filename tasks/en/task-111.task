DESCRIPTION {
   After the last party where lots of people tested our potions, we saw that Midnight Suprise and Dragon Potion
   are both much stronger than expected. They need to upgraded to level 25, and we need to be careful as people started
   flying after taking them.
}

ANSWER {
    UPDATE Potions SET level=25 WHERE potion_id IN (5,3);
}
